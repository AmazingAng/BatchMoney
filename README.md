# Batch.Money

Efficiently transfer ether or tokens to many addresses in batch, powered by [Huff](https://github.com/huff-language/huff-rs) and [WTF Academy](https://wtf.academy).

## Key Features

1. Efficiently transfer ether or tokens in batch. Saves 2~3% gas compared to Disperse App.

2. Support non-standard ERC20 (i.e. [USDT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)).

## Test: Transfer ERC20 to 100 addresses on Goerli

To test the gas consumption fairly, we created a new tokens for different methods. For normal transfer, we record the gas used by transfering token to 1 address, and then multiply it by 100.
